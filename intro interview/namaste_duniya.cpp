1) c++ is a superset of c language.
2) c++ programs can use existing c libraries.
3) c follows topdown approach of programming
while C++ follows bottom up approach.
4) c adopts procedure oriented programming
while c++ adopts oops */

/* what is oop?
oops is a programming approach which revolves 
around the concept of "object" where object is
a real life entity */

/* what is object?
any entity which can be represented as a 
set of properties and set of operations 
performed using the set of properties is known as object*/

1) encapsulation

/* what is class?
class is a blueprint of an object.
class is a description of object,s property set and set of operations.

class is a means to achieve encapsulation.

/* what is object?
object is an instance of a class.

object is a runtime entity
means memory class ko nahi

1) What is meant by preprocessor directive in C++?
The preprocessors are the directives, which 
give instructions to the compiler to 
preprocess the information before actual 
compilation starts.

2) what is header files in c?
A header file is a file with extension . h 
which contains C function declarations and 
macro definitions to be shared between several
 source files.

3) difference btw compiler and linker?
A compiler generates object code files (machine language) from source code.

A linker combines these object code files into an executable.

Many IDEs invoke them in succession, so you never actually see the linker at work. Some languages/compilers do not have a distinct linker and linking is done by the compiler as part of its work.

 -> linker -> source_code.exe  */

/* header files are files that contains the declaration 
of the predefined identifiers
here identifiers can befunction names, 
variables, objects, macros */

/* iostream is a header file which contains the 
declaration of identifiers cin and cout
and '>>' and '<<' operator */

//REFERENCE VARIABLE
//reference means address
//ref. var. means internal pointer
//declare is preceded by & sign(this is not read as address of operator in this case)
//must be initialized during declaration
//only be initialized using already declared variables(in this case x)
//reference variable cannot be updated
